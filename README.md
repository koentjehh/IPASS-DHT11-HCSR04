# library for DHT11 & HC-SR04
 This repository contains:  
 - Libraries for the DHT11 and HC-SR04 sensors (with example code).  
 - An application 'Greenhouse monitor' built with the two libraries.  
 - Doxygen documentation of the libraries.  
 
 The library and all its examples have been tested on an Arduino Due.
 
 Note that these libraries require the 'hwlib' library to work.
